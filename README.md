# Hackathon-Eleven-Strategy

## Introduction
This README file provides an in-depth explanation of the code for the hackathon project. The project aims to predict waiting times at a certain venue by utilizing historical waiting time data, weather data, and additional temporal features. The prediction model is based on the XGBoost algorithm.

## Project Structure
The project comprises several components:

1. **Python Code**: The main code file contains the Python code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction generation.
2. **Data Files**: The project uses several CSV files:
   - `waiting_times_train.csv`: Contains historical waiting time data for training.
   - `waiting_times_X_test_final.csv`: Contains waiting time data for generating predictions.
   - `weather_data.csv`: Contains historical weather data.
3. **Output Files**: After running the code, the following output files are generated:
   - `predictions_final.csv`: Contains the predictions generated by the model.

## Code Explanation

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
1. **Loading Data**: The code loads the training waiting time data (`waiting_times_train.csv`), testing waiting time data (`waiting_times_X_test_final.csv`), and weather data (`weather_data.csv`) using Pandas.
2. **Feature Engineering**: The `add_time_features` function adds various temporal features to the datasets, such as day of week, month, hour, season, etc. This function is applied to all three datasets.
3. **Merging Data**: The code merges the waiting time data with the weather data based on the DATETIME column.
4. **Column Cleanup**: After merging, columns with the suffix `_drop` are removed from the datasets.

### Model Training and Prediction
1. **Data Preparation**: The code prepares the training and testing datasets by selecting relevant features and handling missing values.
2. **Model Definition**: XGBoost Regressor model is defined with hyperparameters optimized for the task.
3. **Pipeline Creation**: A pipeline is created to streamline the data preprocessing and modeling steps.
4. **Model Training**: The pipeline is fitted to the training data.
5. **Prediction Generation**: The model generates predictions for the testing data.
6. **Output Generation**: Predictions are saved to a CSV file (`predictions_final.csv`) along with relevant information such as DATETIME and ENTITY_DESCRIPTION_SHORT.

### Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Ensure all required data files (`waiting_times_train.csv`, `waiting_times_X_test_final.csv`, `weather_data.csv`) are placed in the same directory as the code file.
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies.
3. Run the script.
4. After execution, check the `predictions_final.csv` file for the generated predictions.

## Notes
- The code is optimized for prediction accuracy using XGBoost regressor with carefully tuned hyperparameters.
- Additional optimization or modification may be required based on specific requirements or new data.
